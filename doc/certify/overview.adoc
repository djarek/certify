= Overview

Certify is a C++11, header only library, which provides an abstraction of
platform-specific operations, such as using X.509 certificates from the
Operating System's keystore to perform peer authentication during a TLS
handshake. This library is intended for use with Boost.ASIO's SSL components.
Users of this library are assumed to have at least a basic understanding of the
implementation of the Networking TS in Boost.ASIO. Beginners are recommended to
start with the ASIO tutorial in Boost.Beast documentation to be able to follow
examples in this library.

*Note: Certify is not yet part of Boost.*
