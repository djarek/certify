= HTTPS verification, `<boost/certify/rfc2818_verification.hpp>`


The `rfc2818_verification` class implements a callback that server
authentication during a TLS handshake. Certificate verification is first
performed using CA certificates imported into OpenSSL. If that fails because of
missing CA certificates, the library will utilize platform specific APIs to try
and complete the process. If verification passes and the peer's certificate
chain is authentic, this callback will continue with the verification process,
as specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818[RFC2818].
